Begin with a final project proposal, due on Lec #16. Your proposal should be brief (less than one page), and will have three components:

1.  Project description (a paragraph explaining your topic and its scope).
2.  Methodology and sources (a paragraph describing how you will go about doing your research, whether by consulting books and CDs, or by attending performances or conducting interviews).
3.  Time line (give a rough estimate of how you will use your time to complete the project - this is especially important for ethnographic projects).
