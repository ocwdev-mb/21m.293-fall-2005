Lectures and discussions will be supplemented, where possible, with guest lecture-demonstrations, film or video screenings, and hands-on workshops. Regular attendance of class is required, and students will be expected to actively participate in discussions and in-class workshops.

Papers and Projects

Students are required to write two papers, complete a musical transcription exercise, and produce a final project paper and oral presentation.

Exams and Quizzes

One in-class exam, scheduled on Lec #13, will cover materials from lecture, readings, and listening assignments from the first three units. A short quiz will be given towards the end of the semester. There will be no exam during the final examination period.

Academic Honesty
